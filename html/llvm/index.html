<h1>LLVM Study Notes</h1>
<p>Here are some study notes I made during my still on-going learning of LLVM/compilation techniques. I wrote them here to serve as a memo for myself, and maybe provide an ovrerview for new-comers to llvm. </p>
<p> <a href="ADT.html"> LLVM ADT. </a> ADT means abstract datastructure type, they are like cpp standard library's STL but provides additionaly functionality suitable for llvm/clang's needs. ADT is a base layer for other functionality of llvm/clang, they are less concerned with algorithms used in a compiler, but exhibit good C++ engineering practice. </p>
<p> <a href="passes.html"> LLVM Analysis and Transformation passes. </a>Analyses and transformations are where llvm's most optimization happens(well, at least most target-independent optimization happens).</p>
<p> <a href="mc.html"> LLVM Machine Code Generation. </a> Machine code generation is the process by with LLVM IR get tranformed into object code that can be 'executed' by a CPU.</p>
<p> <a href="jit.html"> LLVM JIT. </a></p>
<p> <a href="polly.html"> Polly. </a> <a href="http://polly.llvm.org"> LLVM's polly subproject</a> is an implementation of the <a href="http://polyhedral.info/"> polyhedral compilation </a> technique, which at optimize <a href="https://polly.llvm.org/doxygen/classpolly_1_1Scop.html"> 'scop'</a> (static control part) loops for data locality (i.e. cache friendly) and vectorization (possibily?).</p>
